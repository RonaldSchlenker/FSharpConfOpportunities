# Opportunities and Collaboration for Speaking at Conferences (F# Topics)

An issue driven repo open for sharing, discussing and collaborating conference / speaking opportunities for F# topics.

How it works
---

* You know a conference or speaking opportunity that can be used to do an F# talk
* You'll talk somewhere? Write it here!
* Open a new issue for that concrete conference with name and date
* Comment on an issue, share ideas, collaborate with others


Goal
---

The repo has an exploratory character. Whether it is useful remains to be seen. One conceivable goal would be concerted actions to bring F# closer to interested people. These don't necessarily have to be developer conferences. They could be specialist conferences with an IT focus, at which, for example, success stories or interesting F# applications in the specialist domain are explained.
